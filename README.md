## DAY - 01
```
Task
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables d , l,s and are already declared and initialized for you. 
You must: Declare variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
Read lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your variables.
Use the operator to perform the following operations: Print the sum of plus your int variable on a new line.
Print the sum of plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
Concatenate with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

## DAY - 04
```
Task
Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, , as a parameter. 
The constructor must assign to after confirming the argument passed as is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , 
the constructor should set to and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, 
you must write the following instance methods: yearPasses() should increase the instance variable by. amIOld() 
should perform the following conditional actions: If, print You are young.. If and, print You are a teenager.. Otherwise, print You are old..
To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you, but you'll be writing everything in the future. 
The code that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method. Don't worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!
